## Why?

As my manga collection continues to grow, I have run into 3 main challenges:

1. I don’t remember what I own anymore
2. I can’t keep track of what I have and have not read
3. I can’t decide what to read

All of these challenges have made reading and growing my physical collection go from an enjoyable hobby to an inconvenient chore. I wanted a simple solution to control the chaos of my growing collection and bring my hobby back to a convenient and enjoyable state.
